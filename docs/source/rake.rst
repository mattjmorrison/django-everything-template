		Rake_ is a command line tool to make common command line tasks
		easier to manage.

		There are a number of rake tasks that ship with django-everything-template::

				1. rake deps:node
				2. rake deps:python[env]
				3. rake deps:ruby
				4. rake docs:build

		To see these tasks and a description of each, use the following command::

				rake -T
