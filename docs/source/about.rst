What is django-everything-template?
===================================

django-everything-template is a collection of everything that I
typically use in a django project. In addition to that this project
contains everything you need to set up all of the following things:

	#. A new Django Project (with multiple environment settings)
	#. A slightly modified directory structure
	#. A robust development environment (bpython, django-debug-toolbar)
	#. A robust unit testing framework (nose, django-nose, coverage)
	#. A robust acceptance testing framework (lettuce)
	#. A robust documentation framework (sphinx)
	#. REST support (django-rest-framework)
	#. An example project & application
	#. Static analysis (flake8)	
	#. Continuous Integration (travis-ci)
	#. An automated way to handle database migrations (south)
	#. Support for less & CoffeeScript (django-compressor)
	#. Support for concatenating and minifying css and javascript (django-compressor)
	#. Dependency management for multiple environments (pip & virtualenv)
	#. An automated way to deploy to a production-like server (capistrano, capistrano-django)
	#. An automated way to create a local production-like server (vagrant & chef)
	#. A convenient collection of rake tasks
